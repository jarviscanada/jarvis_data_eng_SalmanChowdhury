# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate in Computer Science from the University of Windsor, specializing in Software Engineering. I have hands-on experience in full-stack web development, system administration, and AI/ML development. My recent AI internship at Glendor involved developing ensemble face detection systems, achieving a 92% F1 score, and implementing advanced algorithms for medical video analysis. I'm passionate about leveraging data and technology to solve real-world problems, from building intelligent systems that enhance user experiences to creating scalable applications that drive business value. My diverse experience across web development, IT operations, and AI provides me with a unique perspective on how technology can transform industries and enhance people's lives.
